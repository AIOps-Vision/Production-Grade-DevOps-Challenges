## 🚀 From Junior to Tech Lead to Senior – Real Challenges That Drove My Promotions

🔥 This section includes four key real-world challenges I faced and solved during my journey from a Junior DevOps Engineer to a Tech Lead, and eventually to a Senior DevOps Engineer.

 👉 Each story reflects the ownership, innovation, and impact that contributed to my promotions and leadership recognition.

#### Challenge 1: Saving $200K/Year Cloud Bill with FinOps Automation
#### Challenge 2: Rebuilding and Accelerating 60% Broken CI/CD Pipelines Across 3 Teams

 📝 These challenges represent only a small part of the real challenges I've faced and solved throughout my DevOps career — likely less than 10% of the full journey. I chose them because each directly contributed to my career growth from Junior to Tech Lead, and eventually to Senior DevOps Engineer.

**More real challenges and advanced solutions will be added in future updates to this repository as I continue documenting my real-world experiences.**

 I hope these challenges inspire you to take ownership of your work, innovate within your teams, and strive for excellence in everything you do.

 🔁 Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss any of these challenges in more detail. I'm always happy to connect and share insights with fellow professionals in the field!

> These challenges reflect part of what I documented from my **first 4 years** of hands-on experience. In the coming days, I will share additional challenges — along with more in-depth details. 
> I will continue updating this repo with more challenges from the rest of my career as I find time to review and write them accurately.

## 🔥 Challenge 1: Saving $200K/Year Cloud Bill with FinOps Automation

**📊 Situation:** At my educational university, our cloud bill was ballooning to over **$650K per year** due to:

- Unoptimized resources
- Lack of visibility into spending
- Frustrated finance team
- Overwhelmed engineering teams


**🎯 Task:** I took ownership of implementing a FinOps strategy to:

- Gain visibility and control over cloud expenses
- Automate cost optimization processes
- Create a culture of financial accountability


**🛠️ Action:** 

**1. Stakeholder Collaboration**

- Worked with finance, engineering, and product teams
- Established comprehensive FinOps framework

**2. Automation Implementation**

- Built real-time cost monitoring tools
- Developed custom dashboards for project-based cost visualization

**3. Immediate Optimizations**

- Discovered 73 engineers using unnecessary Azure test licenses
- Archived 8 years of repo history to reduce CI/CD build minutes costs
- Automated EC2 dev machine shutdowns after work hours


**📈 Result:** 

- **30% reduction** in cloud costs within 6 months
- **$200K+ annual savings**
- Improved visibility for finance team
- Empowered engineering teams to self-optimize
- Earned recognition and promotion to Tech Lead

## 🔥 Challenge 2: Rebuilding and Accelerating 60% Broken CI/CD Pipelines Across 3 Teams

**📊 Situation:** Our CI/CD infrastructure was in critical condition:

- Frequent build failures
- Deployment delays
- 3 teams using different tools and processes
- General confusion and frustration


**🎯 Task:** Standardize CI/CD processes across all teams while:

- Ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing work
- Improving reliability and speed
- Creating maintainable solutions


**🛠️ Action:** 

**1. Team Collaboration**

- Organized workshops with each team
- Gathered feedback on pain points
- Built consensus on new approach

**2. Pipeline Standardization**

- Implemented Azure DevOps as unified platform
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Built reusable templates for common tasks

**3. Process Improvements**

- Migrated from trunk-based to GitFlow strategy
- Implemented feature-based testing before merge
- Restructured DevOps architecture for clean pipeline flow

**4. Security & Accountability**

- Introduced dedicated build accounts
- Ensured full traceability
- Made infrastructure immutable


**📈 Result:** 

- **60% reduction** in build times
- Increased deployment frequency
- Immutable infrastructure with full traceability
- Higher team satisfaction and productivity
